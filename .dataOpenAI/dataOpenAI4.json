To improve the JSON object list based on the HTML structure provided, we need to adjust the XPath expressions to reflect the actual elements present on the web page. Since the HTML snippet doesn't include the actual elements for the login fields and related actions (like email input, password input, login button, and error message), we need to make assumptions or suggestions based on standard practices and adjust any incorrect or redundant entries in the JSON objects. To proceed, we will maintain consistency across the XPath expressions and check for potential duplications and errors.

Given that we don't have the full HTML for the login page and elements like email input and password input, we need to reduce redundancy in the JSON. Here's an improved attempt to ensure a concise and purportedly correct list based on general assumptions:

```json
[
    {
        "type": "input",
        "request_description": "Field to enter the email address",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//input[@name='email']",
        "error": false
    },
    {
        "type": "input",
        "request_description": "Field to enter the password",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//input[@name='password']",
        "error": false
    },
    {
        "type": "button",
        "request_description": "Button to login",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//button[@type='submit' and contains(text(),'Login')]",
        "error": false
    },
    {
        "type": "text",
        "request_description": "Error message for incorrect email or password",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//div[contains(@class, 'alert') and contains(text(),'Your email or password is incorrect!')]",
        "error": false
    }
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Email and Password**:
   - Using a generic attribute like `name` (assuming standard naming conventions) instead of `id` because attributes might be differently named or dynamically generated.
   - Ensuring the lookup uses `@name` rather than `@id` for broader compatibility unless specific IDs are known.

2. **Login Button**:
   - Changed XPath to look for a `button` element with `type='submit'` and text 'Login'. This is a common convention.
   - This approach covers both the type attribute and visible text, providing a more reliable selection.

3. **Error Message**:
   - Assumed that error messages might be housed in a div with a common class attribute like 'alert'.
   - Used `contains` with class and text to generalize more flexible XPath selectors.

Redundant entries in the JSON object list have been removed to enhance efficiency and avoid duplication. Each element now has a unique description and purpose within the login test case. If further information is available in the complete HTML document, those XPaths can be adjusted with precise attributes (`id`, `name`, `class`) present in the HTML.
