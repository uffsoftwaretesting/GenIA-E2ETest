To create an end-to-end (E2E) test script using Python, Robot Framework, and Selenium based on the given HTML structure and fictional test case `Test_Case_3.feature`, we need to interpret and automate potential user interactions with the web page.

Given the provided HTML snippet and test case description, let's assume we want to test the ability to navigate the website's header links and verify that interactions with elements such as "Add to Cart" buttons work correctly. Hereâ€™s a Robot Framework test script using Selenium that does just that:

```robot framework
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${URL}          https://automationexercise.com
${BROWSER}      Chrome
${HEADLESS}     ${True}

*** Test Cases ***
Test User Navigation and Add to Cart Functionality
    [Setup]    Open Browser to Website
    Navigate to Products Page
    Add First Product to Cart
    Navigate to Cart and Verify Product
    [Teardown]    Close Browser

*** Keywords ***
Open Browser to Website
    Open Browser    ${URL}    ${BROWSER}
    Maximize Browser Window
    # Uncomment the line below if running in headless mode (no GUI)
    # Set Headless Chrome

Navigate to Products Page
    Click Link    Products
    Wait Until Element Is Visible    //div[@class='features_items']

Add First Product to Cart
    Click Element    xpath://a[@data-product-id='1']
    Wait Until Element Is Visible    //div[@class='modal-body']//p[contains(text(), 'Your product has been added to cart.')]

Navigate to Cart and Verify Product
    Click Link    Cart
    Wait Until Element Is Visible    //tbody//td/a[contains(text(), 'Blue Top')]
    Element Text Should Be    //tbody//td/a[contains(text(), 'Blue Top')]    Blue Top

Close Browser
    Close Browser

Set Headless Chrome
    [Arguments]     ${HEADLESS}
    Run Keyword If  ${HEADLESS}    Set Suite Variable    ${BROWSER}=${BROWSER} -headless
# ```

# ### Explanation

# - **Settings**: We specify the libraries we are using. Here, it's primarily `SeleniumLibrary`.
# - **Variables**: Common variables such as the base URL and browser name are declared here. Adjust the URL to match the actual endpoint.
# - **Test Cases**: This test case automates navigating to the products page, adding a product to the cart, and verifying its presence in the cart.
# - **Keywords**: We group related actions into keywords for readability and reusability. Each keyword performs specific actions, such as opening a browser, navigating pages, and interacting with page elements.
#   - `Open Browser to Website`: Opens the specified browser and navigates to the given URL.
#   - `Navigate to Products Page`: Clicks the "Products" link to view the available items.
#   - `Add First Product to Cart`: Interacts with the first product's "Add to Cart" button.
#   - `Navigate to Cart and Verify Product`: Navigates to the cart and verifies that the selected product is there.
#   - `Close Browser`: Closes the browser session after test execution.
#   - `Set Headless Chrome`: Configures the browser to run in headless mode if needed.

# This script assumes the use of Chrome, but you can update the browser settings as needed. Ensure that you have both the Robot Framework and Selenium libraries installed and properly configured before running the test script.
