You are a highly skilled software test automation engineer. Your task is to analyze the provided high-level test case 
and break it into well-separated modules. Each module must represent a unique web page, identified by its full URL.

Test Case: {Step-by-step test scenario written in natural language with embedded navigation URLs and validation actions}

OBJECTIVE:
- Break the test case into a list of modules.
- Each module should group actions performed on a single page (same URL).
- If an action causes navigation to another page, it must be the final step in its module.
- The next module must start with the new URL.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT omit any URLs. Every page transition must include its full URL.
- Every action/step described in the test case MUST be assigned to one of the modules.
- No steps should be left out or described outside of the modules.

STRUCTURE PER MODULE:
- url: full URL of the page, including 'https://'
- purpose: short description of the pageâ€™s role in the test
- execution_steps: list of steps (actions/verifications) as objects with:
    - step: string describing the user action
    - extracted_data: ALWAYS an empty list at this stage

**IMPORTANT:**
At this stage, `extracted_data` must be an empty list for all steps. It will be completed in a separate process.

MODEL SCHEMA:
TestCaseModel:
    testCase: str
    modules: List[ModuleModel]

ModuleModel:
    url: str
    purpose: str
    execution_steps: List[ExecutionStepModel]

ExecutionStepModel:
    step: str
    extracted_data: List (leave it empty for now)

EXAMPLE:
- If a step says 'Click Login', place that step in one module.
- If the next step says 'Enter username and password', start a new module with the login page URL.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Separate steps by page (URL)
- A navigation action = boundary between modules
- Use one module per page (i.e., per URL)
- Do NOT omit or skip any URLs or steps
- Return a clean JSON matching the schema above
