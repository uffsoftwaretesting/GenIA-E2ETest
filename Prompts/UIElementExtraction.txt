You are a QA test automation manager. Your task is to extract only the HTML elements required to execute the following module of a test case:

{Test Case structured in JSON format including execution steps, urls, page modules and validation details["modules"][n]}

Each `execution_step` in the module contains a `step` description. You must analyze the HTML of the corresponding page and extract the elements required to execute **that step**.

### Output Structure:
For each Test Case, return a list of relevant elements to implement the structure example below:

```json
[
    {
        "type": "input",
        "request_description": "Field to enter the user's name",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//*[@id='form']input[1]",
        "step_name" : "Enter incorrect email address and password"
    },
    {
        "type": "input",
        "request_description": "Field to enter the user's email",
        "identifier_type": "XPath",
        "identifier_tracking": "//*[@id='form']input[2]",
        "step_name" : "Enter incorrect email address and password"
    }
]
```

### Important Notes:
- Only include elements required to execute this test case successfully.
- Return a clean, structured JSON array with the relevant elements only.

Be precise, focused, and avoid redundancy.
